## Rules for the Dynamic Analysis VMs

- **RUN MALWARE ON THIS VM ONLY !!!!**
- Disable Access to the Internet
- Disable share drives
- Use Snapshots
- Set Different Background Color like "Red" to differentiate between the static and dynamic analysis VM

## Windows 10 Pro

For the Dynamic Analysis VM, we can clone the latest Snapshot of the Static Analysis VM and Rename it as "`Dynamic Analysis VM`".

<Steps>

1. To do so, first open the Snapshot Manager as shown in the image below.

4. In the `Clone Type` section, I will select the `Create a linked clone` option, as I know I won't be deleting the Static Analysis VM and this will help save storage space.

5. Enter a preferred name for this VM. I’ll name it `Dynamic Windows 10 x64`. Also, select the location to store your VM files; I’ll leave this set to the default location.

## Remnux

The Remnux VM we imported is our second Dynamic Analysis VM. We don't need to do much with it since we've already taken a snapshot of the VM.

Now its time to create a isolated virtual network for our Dynamic Analysis VMs.
