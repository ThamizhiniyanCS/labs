- Allow Access to the Internet
- Use Snapshots

### Windows 10 Pro Static Analysis VM

The Windows 10 Pro VM that we have built so far ( The Mimial or The Complete Version ) is the Static Analysis VM. You can rename it to Static Analysis VM if you have named it different initially.

Now Take a Snapshot of the VM. I will name the Snapshot as "`Static Analysis Baseline`".
