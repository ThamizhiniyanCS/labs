This guide provides instructions for two different setups. The first is a **Minimal Setup**, a lightweight configuration with essential tools for basic analysis. The second is the **Flare VM**, a more comprehensive, resource-intensive setup that includes nearly all tools required for a complete reverse engineering and malware analysis environment.

If you have limited resources or storage constraints, follow the steps for the [Minimal Setup](#The-Minimal-Setup). If you have sufficient resources, you can opt for the more comprehensive [Flare VM](#The-Complete-Setup---Flare-VM) setup.
