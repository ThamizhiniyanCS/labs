I used Flare VM for a while, but found it to be somewhat buggy and slow. This led me to explore alternatives, and I came up with the idea for this minimal setup. Inspired by [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adAr0KBJm4U), this setup includes all the applications and tools I believe will cover most of my analysis needs for now.

This section includes the installation instructions for all the applications and tools I will be installing in the Minimal Setup.

## Default Applications

- I used [Ninite](https://ninite.com/) to download and install all essential tools at once, including browsers, runtimes, developer tools, and more. Below is an image showing the tools I selected to install on the VM. After selecting all the necessary tools, click the `Get Your Ninite` button to download the `Ninite` installer. This setup will automatically download and install all the selected tools.

  ![image.png](../../assets/image%2019.png)

- Once you've downloaded the Ninite installer, it's time to transfer it to the VM. First, click on `VM` -> `Grab Input` (as shown in the image below) to enable drag-and-drop functionality between the host and the guest system.

  ![image.png](../../assets/image%2020.png)

- Now drag-and-drop the installer to the VM as shown in the following the image.

  ![image.png](../../assets/image%2021.png)

- Now, double-click the installer to begin downloading and installing all the selected tools.

  ![image.png](../../assets/image%2022.png)

- You can see the progress of each application by clicking on the `Show details` button.

  ![image.png](../../assets/image%2023.png)

- Once the installation is finished without any errors you can close the installer.

- You can reuse the `Ninite` installer later to update and upgrade all the tools it initially installed.
