Here are the instructions to setup the Windows 10 Pro VM on VMware Workstation Pro.

<Steps>

1. First open VMware Workstation Pro and click on `File` -> `New Virtual Machine`.

3. Now select the `Use ISO image` option, select the Windows 10 ISO that you have downloaded using the `Browse` option and click on `Next`.

4. In the `Easy Install Information` section, select `Windows 10 Pro` as the version of Windows to install. Under `Personalize Windows`, enter a preferred name. You may set a password if desired, I’ll leave it blank as I don't want to setup a password for login. If you have a Product Key you can enter it here. In my case, I don't have one. So I leaved it empty. Click `Next` to proceed.

5. Click on `Next` when it throws a warning related to `Product Key`.

6. Enter a preferred name for this VM. I’ll name it `Static Windows 10 x64` since this VM will be used for static analysis, and I’ll later clone it for dynamic analysis and configure it accordingly. Also, select the location to store your VM files; I’ll leave this set to the default location.

7. Make sure that the `Maximum disk size` is set to `60 GB` and click on `Next`.

8. Now in this section, make sure that the settings that is showing for you is somewhat similar to the settings that is shown in the image below. Once you have checked it click on the `Customize Hardware` option if you want to modify any of the settings.

9. Here is my VM settings that will be shown after the `Customize Hardware` is clicked. Once you have customized the settings close this window.

10. Now click on `Finish`.

11. Once you click `Finish`, VMware will allocate space and create the virtual disks required for the VM.

12. Once the virtual disks are created, the VM will start automatically, and the Windows 10 Pro OS installation will begin. You don’t need to do anything, as the installation will proceed automatically. Feel free to take a break while the OS installs.

13. Once the installation is completed, you can see the Windows 10 Pro Desktop as shown in the image below.

14. Now, shut down the VM. It’s a good idea to take a snapshot of the VM at this stage, so that if anything goes wrong during the tool installation, you can revert to this freshly installed state. To take a snapshot, right-click on the VM you created in the VM `Library`, then select `Snapshot` -> `Take Snapshot`.

15. Now give a name to this snapshot that is quite descriptive. I name it as `Base Snap Fresh Install`. Then click on `OK`.

16. We have successfully completed the Windows 10 Pro installation on a VM. Now its time to install the tools that is necessary for Malware Analysis.
