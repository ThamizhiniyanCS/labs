3. Enter a preferred name for this VM. I’ll name it `remnux-v7-focal`. Also, select the location to store your VM files; I’ll leave this set to the default location.

4. Now allow VMware to import the OVA file and setup the VM.

5. Once the VM is successfully imported, take a snapshot, right-click on the VM you created in the VM `Library`, then select `Snapshot` -> `Take Snapshot`.

6. Now give a name to this snapshot that is quite descriptive. I name it as `Base Snap Fresh Import`. Then click on `OK`.
