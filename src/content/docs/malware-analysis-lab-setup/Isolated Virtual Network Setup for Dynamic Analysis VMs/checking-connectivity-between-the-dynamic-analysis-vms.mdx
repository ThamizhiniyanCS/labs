Run both the Dynamic Analysis Virtual machines and follow the steps to check the connectivity:

- First check the ip address of both the machines
  - On Remnux: `ifconfig`

  - On Windows: `ipconfig`
    ![image](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020241107165725.png)
- Next Ping 8.8.8.8 ( Google’s DNS ) and 1.1.1.1 ( Cloudflare’s DNS ) from both the VMs. We expect the pings request to fail according to our network configuration.
  - On Remnux: `ping 8.8.8.8 -c 1` and `ping 1.1.1.1 -c 1`

  - On Windows: `ping 8.8.8.8 -c 1` and `ping 1.1.1.1 -c 1`

- Next we are going to check whether both the VMs can communicate with each other.

  - On Remnux: `ping 172.16.172.129`
    ![image](../assets/Pasted%20image%2020241107170926.png)

  - From the above image, you can see that there is no response to the ping requests from the windows VM. This is due to the default behavior of Windows OS to not respond to ping requests.
  - So to check the connectivity, I created a simple `python http server` on the Windows Dynamic Analysis VM using the following command.

    ```bash
    python -m http.server
    ```

  - Next, visit the following URL from the Remnux Dynamic Analysis VM: http://172.16.172.129:8000.

  - We are able to access the `http` server as shown in the image above, which shows that we are able to connect to the Windows VM.
    - On Windows: `ping 172.16.172.128`

Our Network settings work perfectly.
