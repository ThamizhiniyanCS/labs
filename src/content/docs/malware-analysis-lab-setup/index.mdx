## Introduction

This is my complete lab setup, which I will be using for Reverse Engineering and Malware Analysis, specifically focused on analyzing Windows-based malware. Please note that this setup may be updated based on my needs, so it is not a standard configuration. If you have any questions, issues, suggestions, or improvements, feel free to raise an issue on GitHub.
