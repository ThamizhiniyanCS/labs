<Aside title="REMnux can't be used in ARM based processors !!!!">
  REMnux is based on a x86/amd64 version of Ubuntu, and won't run on an ARM
  processor such as Apple M1. You can set up a Linux distribution, such as Kali
  Linux, on a VM that supports ARM-based processors and install the following
  tools: `INetSim` and `Wireshark`.
</Aside>

I'll be using the prebuilt REMnux VM image. You can explore additional installation methods in the official Remnux documentation: [https://docs.remnux.org/](https://docs.remnux.org/). Below are the instructions for obtaining the Remnux OVA file.

- Visit the following link and download the OVA file as shown in the following image.
